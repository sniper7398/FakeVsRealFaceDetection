# FakeVsRealFaceDetection
This repo is about detecting or verifying a real image/face and a fake or altered face/image.
I have used ResNet architecture for my model.I have used Kaggle dataset and trained my model on it.
Other varient like mobilenetV2 can also be used, as it is lighter in size.
I haven't uploaded trained model as it is big in size.
